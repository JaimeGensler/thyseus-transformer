This is the official transformer plugin for
[Thyseus](https://www.github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus).

Currently, the transformer is available as a Vite plugin only - if you'd like to
see a plugin for your bundler of choice, feel free to
[create an issue](https://github.com/JaimeGensler/thyseus-transformer/issues/new)
and request your bundler!

## Installation

**The transformer will be released alongside Thyseus v0.12. Installation
instructions will be available then.**
