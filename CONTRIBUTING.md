# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Thyseus transformer! Please
review this document and the [code of conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before
submitting any pull requests.

## Requesting Bundlers

One of the most valuable contributions you can make is simply requesting a
bundler plugin! We currently don't know what bundlers people are using with
Thyseus, so it's difficult to know what to prioritize. At the same time, we
don't want to spend time/effort creating plugins for bundlers that are simply
not used for development with Thyseus. If you create a bundler request, it is
**highly likely** that a plugin will be added for it!

## Pull Requests

**_Please - ask before starting any work_**. Contributions are welcome and
encouraged; however, working with source code transformation can be difficult
and time consuming, and frequently involves making trade-offs. As a result, most
transformer contributions will require some initial discussion around what is
possible and the implications of the transformation. Create an issue discussing
the work you'd like to do, ping me in it, and I'll be sure to look as soon as
I'm able!

### General Guidelines
